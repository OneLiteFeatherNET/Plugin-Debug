# Plugin Debug

## Description
Plugin Debug is a simple and modern library for collect some debug information of your plugin.  
This library is inspired by Debug Paste of @IntellectualSites

## Motivation
We maintain now more than one plugin/software plugin in java. Now it's time to build an api/library to help us to provide better support for users there use our plugins. 

## Focus
Our focus lies within a basic implementation of a generic api for collect server information and upload to a (custom) [bytebin](https://github.com/lucko/bytebin) server .
